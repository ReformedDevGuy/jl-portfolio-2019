      <h2>John Larson, Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for Web Development started in 2009. Since then I have
        utilized both college courses and self-taught methods in order
        to create beautiful and efficent web solutions for small
        businesses and individuals in need of an online presence. The main technologies
        I utilize are Angular and React, and I incorporate Bootstrap and Material
        Design elements when necessary to ensure compatibility across all platforms.
        </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Despite focusing on front-end technologies, I have extensive  experience with back-end 
        languages/runtimes, frameworks, and databases, including NodeJS, Express, PHP, and Python.
        I have experience with SQL databases, like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Percona and
        MariaDB, and I also frequently utilize NoSQL databases like MongoDB and CouchDB. My
        experience in Network Administration also means I am able to utilize server technologies
        such as IIS on Windows Servers and Apache on Linux servers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My skills include: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, Git, React, Redux, Angular,
        Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, PHP and SQL
