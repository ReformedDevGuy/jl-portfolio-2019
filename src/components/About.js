      <h2>John Larson, Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        I am a creative web developer with a focus on front-end web technologies.
        My passion for Web Development started in 2009 when I first attended college, 
        and since then I have been driven towards learning as much as I can in order 
        to create beautiful and efficent websites and web applications for small 
        businesses and individuals in need of an online presence. Over the past 10 
        years I have taken a self-learning path to increase my skills and knowledge 
        of the latest technologies, and recently I enrolled in classes to finish my 
        degree. The main technologies I utilize are Angular and React, and I incorporate 
        Bootstrap and Angular Material Design when necessary to ensure compatibility 
        across all platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite focusing on front-end technologies, I have extensive experience working 
        with back-end frameworks and databases, including NodeJS, Express, PHP, and Python. 
        I have experience with SQL databases, like MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Percona and 
        MariaDB, and I also frequently utilize NoSQL databases like MongoDB and CouchDB. My 
        experience in Network Administration also means I am able to utilize server technologies 
        such as IIS on Windows Servers, Apache on Ubuntu and Debian servers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My skills include: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, Git, React, Redux, Angular, 
        Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, PHP and SQL
      </p>
